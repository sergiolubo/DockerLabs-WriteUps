# DockerLabs Writeups

In this repository, I will upload WriteUps of the machines from the DockerLabs platform. At [DockerLabs](https://dockerlabs.es), you can download controlled Docker environments and automatically deploy using a bash script. These environments are ideal for practising ethical hacking and pen-testing.

## What is DockerLabs?
[DockerLabs](https://dockerlabs.es) is a platform that provides Docker-based lab environments specifically designed to learn and practice cybersecurity skills. These environments are preconfigured with various applications and settings containing known vulnerabilities, allowing users to experiment and safely learn about them.

- [DockerLabs](https://dockerlabs.es): The official DockerLabs website provides more information about the platform and access to the lab environments.

## Repository Structure
- **MachineName.md**: Each file will be labelled with the name of the corresponding machine and will contain the step-by-step solution.
- **README.md**: This file you are reading right now provides an overview of the repository and how to use it.
